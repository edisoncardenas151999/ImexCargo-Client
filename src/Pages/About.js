          A one-of-a-kind Porsche, seafood, millions of dollars in artwork,
          large-scale technology equipment, natural disaster relief goods,
          pharmaceuticals, live animals, human remains, personal effects, and
          aircraft engines are just some of the items ImEx Cargo LLC has
          specialized in transporting internationally and domestically over the
          20+ years. With more than 30 years of knowledge and experience in
          logistics transportation and airline cargo sales, ImEx Cargo CEO and
          founder, Michelle DeFronzo, ensures goods arrive safely and on time.
          Her experience in international shipping means that she knows cargo
          transportation, logistics and supply chain protocols intimately, in
          addition to how to treat clients—and “the key”, she says, “begins with
          listening closely to best understand client needs”. Based in Peabody,
          ImEx Cargo is the top, independently- and woman-owned worldwide
          general airline sales and service agent for New England, New York, New
          Jersey, and Philadelphia. In 2016, ImEx Cargo received the first of
          numerous woman-owned diverse supplier certifications and can help
          companies achieve supplier diversity goals. ImEx Cargo became a
          federal government-certified contractor in 2016 and manages government
          contracts under the Supplier Diversity Program.
